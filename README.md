# WGLT Roguelike Tutorial

Implementation of [/r/roguelikedev](https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/)'s annual [Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/br1sv3/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [WGLT](https://wglt.js.org/).

Goals:
* TypeScript for modern, statically typed browser development
* Mobile web and touch support

## Development

Clone:
```
git clone git@github.com:codyebberson/wglt-roguelike-tutorial.git
```

Start webpack:
```
npm run dev
```

## Notes

These docs assume some basic familiarity with Node, npm, and TypeScript.

If you've never used TypeScript, but you have used JavaScript, then you should
be able to follow along.  Please forgive my efforts to convert you.

### Part 0 - Setting Up

npm dependencies:
* [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) - to be able to use the TypeScript language
* [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) and [webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli) - to bundle everything into a single .js output
* [ts-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-loader) - to connect webpack and typescript
* [wglt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wglt) - for roguelike development

**What are all these files?** NPM, TypeScript, and Webpack can result in a lot of configuration files.  Here's a quick cheatsheet that explains each of them.  Note that many of the files were generated by NPM and GTS.

| File or Directory   | Description                                                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dist                | TypeScript compiler output.  Ignore most of the files in here.             |
| src                 | TypeScript source code.  **Do most of your work here.**                    |
| .clang-format       | TypeScript formatting configuration (generated by GTS).                    |
| .gitattributes      | Git file attributes configuration, mostly to fix CR, LF, CRLF issues.      |
| .gitignore          | Git ignored files list.                                                    |
| README.md           | This file!                                                                 |
| graphics.png        | Sprites and tiles in PNG format, used when deployed.                       |
| graphics.xcf        | Sprites and tiles in GIMP format, used for editing.                        |
| index.html          | The actual HTML file used when deployed.                                   |
| package-lock.json   | NPM dependency details (generated by NPM).                                 |
| package.json        | NPM project details.                                                       |
| prettier.config.js  | Code formatting details (generated by GTS).                                |
| tsconfig.json       | TypeScript configuration file.                                             |
| tslint.json         | TypeScript linter configuration details (generated by GTS).                |
| webpack.config.js   | Webpack configuration file.                                                |

### Part 1 - Drawing the ‘@’ symbol and moving it around

Most of this exercise is provided for free by WGLT.  The main task is to initialize the WGLT library.

### Part 2 - The generic Entity, the render functions, and the map

Almost everything is provided for free by WGLT.  Added some test walls to the otherwise empty map.

### Part 3 - Dungeon generation

Verbatim port of the Python tutorial to Typescript.

### Part 4 - Field of View

Nothing to do!  Field of view is included in the WGLT library.  The only notable difference is that WGLT darkens (50% alpha black overlay) tiles, whereas the Python tutorial uses different colors entirely.

### Part 5 - Placing enemies

Creating enemies using the WGLT Actor class.
