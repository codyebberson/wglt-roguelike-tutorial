# WGLT Roguelike Tutorial

Implementation of [/r/roguelikedev](https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/)'s annual [Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/br1sv3/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [WGLT](https://wglt.js.org/).

## Development

Clone:

```
git clone git@github.com:codyebberson/wglt-roguelike-tutorial.git
```

Start dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

## Notes

These docs assume some basic familiarity with Node, npm, and TypeScript.

If you've never used TypeScript, but you have used JavaScript, then you should
be able to follow along. Please forgive my efforts to convert you.

## Week 1

### Part 0 - Setting Up

npm dependencies:

- [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) - to be able to use the TypeScript language
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - to run a dev server and build production bundles
- [wglt](https://wglt.js.org/) - for roguelike development

**What are all these files?** JavaScript/TypeScript projects can result in a lot of configuration files. Here's a quick cheatsheet that explains each of them. Note that many of the files were generated by NPM and GTS.

| File or Directory  | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dist               | TypeScript compiler output. Ignore most of the files in here. |
| src                | TypeScript source code. **Do most of your work here.**        |
| .gitignore         | Git ignored files list.                                       |
| README.md          | This file!                                                    |
| index.html         | The HTML entry point.                                         |
| package-lock.json  | NPM dependency details (generated by NPM).                    |
| package.json       | NPM project details.                                          |
| tsconfig.json      | TypeScript configuration file.                                |

### Part 1 - Drawing the ‘@’ symbol and moving it around

Most of this exercise is provided for free by WGLT. The main task is to initialize the WGLT library.

The code is taken from the [WGLT Hello World](https://wglt.js.org/examples/hello.html) example:

```ts
import { Colors, Terminal } from 'wglt';

const WIDTH = 80;
const HEIGHT = 45;

const term = new Terminal(document.querySelector('canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
term.fillRect(0, 0, 80, 45, 0, Colors.YELLOW, Colors.DARK_BLUE);

let x = 10;
let y = 10;

term.update = () => {
  const moveKey = term.getMovementKey();
  if (moveKey) {
    x += moveKey.x;
    y += moveKey.y;
  }

  term.clear();
  term.drawString(1, 1, 'Hello world!');
  term.drawString(1, 3, 'Use arrow keys to move');
  term.drawString(x, y, '@');
};
```
